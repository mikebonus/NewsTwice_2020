This application was originally designed/created by <b>'AndroidDevs(@android_devs)'</b> <br />
and I (<b>Mikebonus</b>) got his permission to scale up his original <b>'MVVMNewsApp'</b> application <br />
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asuOWE5KuFM&list=PLQkwcJG4YTCRF8XiCRESq1IFFW8COlxYJ (VIDEO SERIES) <br /> 
to the next level, as I've added additional features to make this incredibly well-coordinated 
application <br /> even more dynamic, powerful, and professional.

The original application enables users to find the latest breaking news happening in the US (ie. US: 1 country), 
and <b>AndroidDevs</b> used Retrofit/GSON to make a network request / create the data model to / from 
the remote data source (REST-API: https://newsapi.org/) 

On top of his original application, what I've (<b>Mikebonus</b>) done are as follows.

<b>1)</b> The user can now choose a flag (among 15 national flags representing 15 different countries) 
on the main screen (see images below) and by simply clicking one, he/she would be taken to a 
large list of news from that selected country.   

<b>2)</b> Added the ToolBar + Options Menu on the top right corner of every page of this app to allow 
users to change language settings, thereby enabling them to easily read news from any one of the 
15 countries in the list.

<b>3)</b> Inserted some space between each of the articles that are listed for improving user's readability 
and also changed the theme color of the overall application (light-green) for cleaner look 
(see images below). 

<b>4)</b> Fully commented on the entire source code of the application for anyone interested in reviewing
the source code to easily follow along.

<b>5)</b> Ensured that the new UI added to this application stays responsive to all devices of any size
and perfectly copes with screen rotation.

<b>6)</b> Added Notification Alert for informing the user how to save / delete each article to make 
this application more intuitive and user-friendly.

<b>7)</b> Restricted the user to use only English in search-menu to solidify the response rate of
articles + restricted the max number of lines of search-textview to 1 single line.

<b>8) Fastened the loading speed of articles / corresponding images. </b> 

<b>9)</b> Enabled caching thereby enhancing the loading speed of articles coming through.

<b>10)</b> Now videos are loaded successfully through the webview.

<b>11)</b> Added default images to the articles coming through without default images by manipulating Glide-library

<b>12)</b> Switched the OptionsSelectedItem menu icon on the top right (to make it visually look more visible and intuitive) 

<b>13)</b> Enhanced search-functionality. The new version now enables users to perform search with 'new-results' replacing
the old results + also handled the requests-overloading issue with a dialog to take the user back to the main screen. 

<b>14)</b> Since this application was not given its name, I tentatively named this application 
<b>'News Twice'</b> following after my very own application <b>'Coding Twice'</b> 
(https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sampler.codingtwice_v3) on Google Play. 

<b>15)</b> Made a request up to 500 times until the number of possible requests per day ran out, and checked the TOAST-message coming through.

Big appreciation goes to <b>'AndroidDevs' (@android_devs)</b> once again for allowing me to take 
this opportunity to scale up this amazing application. <br /><br />
